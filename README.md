This repository contains a Python case study focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis on 
Wine Quality Dataset. It includes data preprocessing, and exploratory analysis using Python.
The dataset includes different attributes of wines along with their quality ratings.
Dataset: Download the "Wine Quality" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository:www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/wine-quality-dataset

a. Load and display the first few rows of the dataset.
b. Check for any missing values in the dataset.

2. Distribution of Wine Quality:
a. Explore the distribution of wine quality ratings.
b. Visualize it using a bar chart or histogram.

3. Correlation Analysis:
a. Examine the correlation between different attributes and wine quality.
b. Create a correlation matrix and visualize it.

4. Feature Analysis:
a. Analyze the distribution of key features such as alcohol content, acidity, etc.
b. Compare the features across different quality ratings.

5. Visualizing Relationships:
a. Create scatter plots to visualize relationships between pairs of features.
b. Use color-coding to distinguish between different quality ratings.

6. Inferential Statistics:
a. Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) for a chosen feature.
b. Discuss any insights or patterns observed.
